<br>
In this mini project, you are required to simulate a mobile network in a selected area of 10kmx10km. You are required to deploy three base stations in the given area such a way that it minimizes the interference to each other.

Consider the minimum received signal strength for mobile users are -110dBm. You may accordingly adjust the transmit signal strength of the Base station.

Deploy 100 mobile users and provide them a predefined mobility pattern. Use the path â€“ loss model for calculating the power.

<strong>Attachment to a Base station: </strong>

Mobile users will attached with the Base station based on the SINR.

<strong>Resource allocation: </strong>

Consider only 20 users shall connect to a base station at any given time. Create a random process to generate calls and terminate calls assuming only 25% of users are active at any given time.

Tasks:

<ol>

 <li>Investigate the impact of signal strength by incrementally increasing the signal power at the base station.</li>

 <li>What is the optimal signal strength the base station may operate at?</li>

</ol>
